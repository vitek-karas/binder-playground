# AssemblyLoadContext "building blocks" Prototype 

A way to implement loading of components with dependencies with ability to build assembly load context from building blocks to get the desired behavior.

See comments on the classes and properties for the intent and details.

Obviously WIP - still lot of interesting cases to cover (native dependencies, satellite assemblies, ...)
